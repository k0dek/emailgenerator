   - Implement email marketing best practices (e.g., "Rule of One", personalization)
   - Craft an engaging subject line and preview text
   - Structure body content for maximum impact and readability
   - Design a clear and compelling call-to-action (CTA)

4. UI Integration:
   - Display the generated email content in the TipTap-based editor
   - Allow users to easily modify and format the content as needed
   - Provide options to copy, save, or further edit the optimized email

## Additional Features:
